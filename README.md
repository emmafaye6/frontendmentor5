# Front end mentor challenge: Single price grid component

## Project description

- Simple HTML, CSS using grid project with Prettier
- [Front End Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc)
- The challenge for this project was to make a Single price grid component that was fully responsive with a mobile-first approach.

## What I've learned

This is my first time using grid, I was quite used to using Flexbox and was always intimidated by grid, because of all the numbers and stuff. Now that I've used it, I am so looking forward to using it on more projects because it is just so useful and fast. I had to look up a few things but [this cheat sheet by Css tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) helped me a lot.
